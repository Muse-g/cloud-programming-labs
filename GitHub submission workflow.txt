GitHub submission workflow (online editors + commits, branches, tags)
GitHub submission workflow (online editors + commits, branches, tags)
Use this guide to set up GitHub, connect your repo to an online editor (Replit, CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, Colab, PythonAnywhere), and submit tasks as a clean series of commits (optionally using branches or tags).

Additional manual for using it is located in resources (click to download).Posłuchaj zawartości strony

Quickstart checklist (do this in order)
Create a GitHub account and verify your email.
Create a repo for the course (Public recommended for easiest online-editor import).
Create folders for tasks and put files in the correct task folder.
For each subtask: implement → run → commit → push/sync.
Optionally: create a branch per task or add a tag per completed task.
Submit your GitHub repo link in Moodle (plus branch/tag/commit ID if requested).
Course rule of thumb: one subtask = one commit (unless the task explicitly requires grouping).
1) Create a GitHub account (once)
Open: https://github.com/
Click Sign up and follow the prompts.
Verify your email address (required for common actions like creating repositories).
If you already have an account, you only need to ensure email verification is complete.

2) Create your course repository (once)
Option A (recommended): one repo for the whole course
In GitHub (top-right), click + → New repository.
Repository name example: cloud-programming-labs
Visibility: Public (simplest for imports).
Initialize with README.md.
Option B: separate repo per language/project
python-labs
nodejs-labs
Use this only if the course explicitly wants separate repositories.

Tip: Public repos are easier to import into most online editors. If you use Private repos, you may need to authorize tool access via OAuth/GitHub Apps.
3) Recommended repository structure (grading-friendly)
Use a predictable folder layout so each task is easy to locate:

/python/
  /task0/
  /task1/
  /task1b/
  /task1c/
  /task2/
  /task2b/
  /task3a/
  /task3b/
  /task3c/

/js/
  /task0/
  ...
File naming: use the exercise IDs as filenames when possible (example):

python/task1/S1_VAR_01.py
python/task1/S1_VAR_02.py
python/task2/S2_LIST_01.py
...
4) Commits: how to submit each exercise
A commit is a recorded snapshot of changes in your branch. For coursework, commits are your submission history: the instructor can see exactly what you did per task/subtask.

Recommended cycle (repeat for every subtask)
Implement the exercise in the correct file/folder.
Run the code and confirm it works (print output or assertions/tests).
Commit the changes with a clear message.
Push/Sync to GitHub (so the instructor can access it).
Quality bar: your code must run from a clean start without manual edits.
5) Commit messages: how to write them
Each commit must include a message that briefly describes what changed. Keep messages consistent so grading is fast.

Course commit message format (use this)
TASK<N>: <EXERCISE_ID> - short description
Examples
TASK1: S1_VAR_01 - type() catalog + printed table
TASK1B: S1_IF_02 - score-to-grade with boundary tests
TASK2: S2_LIST_03 - chunk(list, size) + invalid size handling
TASK3C: S3_PIPE_06 - pipe_safe with exception capture
What makes a message “good”
Mentions the task and exercise ID (so it maps to Moodle tasks)
States the outcome, not vague intent (“implemented …” is fine; “work” is not)
Matches the changes in the commit (don’t mix unrelated fixes in one commit)
6) Choose a workflow strategy
Strategy A — Single branch (main only)
Work directly on main and push commits after each subtask.

Pros: simplest
Cons: less separation between tasks (still acceptable for solo work)
Strategy B — Branch per task
Create a new branch per task, commit subtasks there, then merge to main.

Branch name examples:

task1-vars-types
task2-lists
task3c-pipelines
Optional: merge via a Pull Request to keep history clean.

Strategy C — Tags as “checkpoints”
Add a tag when you finish a full task to mark a stable checkpoint (useful if you continue working later).

Tag name examples:

task1-done
task2-done
python-task3c-done
Tags are attached to a specific commit (a specific point in history). You can also create a Release from a tag if needed.

7) Connect GitHub with online editors
https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workspace-features/git-interface#how-to-access-the-git-pane

Recommendation: Treat GitHub as the source of truth. Make changes in your editor, then push them to GitHub via the editor’s Git integration.
7.1 Replit (Python + Node/JS) 
ReplIt is not recommended anymore because of hard use of AI Agent

Import from GitHub (Replit Import): https://docs.replit.com/getting-started/quickstarts/import-from-github
Authorize GitHub access when prompted.
Open the Git pane in Replit, stage files, write a commit message, commit, and push.
Replit’s Git interface supports staging, committing, and pushing to GitHub inside the browser.

Docs:

https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workspace-features/git-interface
https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workspace-features/version-control
7.2 CodeSandbox (strong for web/Node projects)
Import repository: https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/repositories/getting-started/repo-import
Select your GitHub org/user and repo (or paste the repo URL).
Use the Git workflow panel: write commit message → Commit → Sync changes.
Docs:

https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/repositories/getting-started/git-workflow
https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/repositories/overview
https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/integrations/github-app
7.3 StackBlitz (run web projects from GitHub; Codeflow can push commits)
Open a GitHub repo in StackBlitz:

https://stackblitz.com/github/<USER>/<REPO>
For a specific branch/tag/commit: .../tree/<BRANCH_OR_TAG_OR_COMMIT>
Docs:

https://developer.stackblitz.com/guides/user-guide/importing-projects
https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/working-in-codeflow-ide
https://developer.stackblitz.com/guides/user-guide/general-faqs
If you use Codeflow, you can commit and push changes back to GitHub via the Source Control workflow. If you use the classic editor, treat StackBlitz mainly as a runner/viewer and push changes via another method.

7.4 Google Colab (Python notebooks)
Open notebooks from GitHub:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/
For consistent grading, prefer committing .py files. If you work in .ipynb, keep matching .py versions when required.

7.5 PythonAnywhere (Python + Git via Bash console)
PythonAnywhere provides a Linux-like environment. Use a Bash console to run git: clone, commit, push, pull.

Practical notes:

For private repos: generate SSH keys in Bash and add the public key to GitHub SSH keys.
For HTTPS: use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your GitHub password.
8) Authentication (PAT/SSH) when using terminal Git
Important: passwords do not work for Git operations over HTTPS
If you run git clone/git push from a terminal (local machine, PythonAnywhere, etc.), GitHub requires secure authentication methods. When Git prompts for a password, you typically use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead.

Official docs:

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens
PAT vs SSH: what to choose (simple guidance)
Use PAT (HTTPS) if you want the simplest setup and your editor/terminal supports pasting the token when prompted.
Use SSH if you want password-less terminal Git. Generate a key pair, add the public key to GitHub, and use SSH URLs.
Never commit secrets: do not push API keys, tokens, passwords, or private keys into GitHub. If a secret was committed, rotate it immediately.
9) What to submit in Moodle (recommended)
Submit a single GitHub link, plus an identifier that points to the exact work you want graded.

Submit ONE of the following “pointers”
Branch (if using branch-per-task): e.g., task2-lists
Tag (if using checkpoints): e.g., task2-done
Commit SHA (exact snapshot): e.g., a1b2c3d...
Example Moodle submission text
Repository: https://github.com/<YOUR_USER>/cloud-programming-labs
Task submitted: TASK2
Pointer: tag task2-done
Notes: all subtasks are in /python/task2/ as separate .py files
